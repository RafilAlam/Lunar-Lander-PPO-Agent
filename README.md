## 🧠 What It Does
This project demonstrates a clean PPO implementation capable of training an agent to autonomously land a spacecraft in OpenAI Gymnasium’s `LunarLander-v3` (continuous action space). All logic is written from scratch.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🔁 **PPO algorithm from scratch**
- 🎮 **Supports continuous action spaces**
- 📉 **Live training performance graph**
- 💾 **Model saving & loading**
- 🧪 **Separate training & inference modes**
- 📈 **Learning curve visualization**

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Gymnasium (`LunarLander-v3`, `continuous=True`)
- Matplotlib (for learning curves)
